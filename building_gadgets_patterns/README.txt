Requirements: 
	● A Copy-Paste Gadget from the Building Gadgets mod
	● One Template Manager from the Building Gadgets mod
	● Some form of power (FE) generation*
	
Loading an External Template
	1) Locate the template you wish to import in this folder.
	2) Open it as a text file and copy the entire contents of the file.
	3) Open the Template Manager's interface.
	4) Place the Copy-Paste Gadget in the lower slot, the one the arrow is pointing at. 
	5) Click the Paste button in the interface. 
	
At this point, the template is loaded and may be used to paste the structure in your world. The Gadget may still be in "Copy" mode and will need to be switched to "Paste" mode in order to work. With the Gadget in hand, press and hold the Building Gadgets "Settings Menu" keybind** to open the gui. 

A list of required building materials can be viewed by holding the Gadget and pressing the "Open Material List" keybind**. These materials must be present in your inventory or in a Dank Storage item in your inventory. 

With the materials in hand and the Gadget in "Paste" mode, simply point at where the structure should be built and right-click. 

Note that the Copy-Paste Gadget can also use Construction Paste if certain blocks are missing. While this is great for pasting in an expensive decorative build, this will not work for functional multiblocks. 

Finally, some templates will require some manual effort once pasted. For example, the Gadget is not capable of placing the Turbine Blades for Mekanism's Industrial Turbine. These must be installed by hand.

*	This pack offers many options for power generation, many of which are very accessible. For example, consider Thermal's Dynamos for some simple options that can get you started without much trouble. 
** 	Check your Controls for the appropriate keybind. 

Optional:
  For those who may learn best with a visual example, the mod maker himself spotlighted Building Gadgets. You can check out DireWolf20 covering the basics of using the Template Manager here:

    "Mod Spotlight Building Gadgets v2" -- https://youtu.be/JS1Xx_kwQQ0?t=749

  The link above should jump you right to where he covers the Template Manager. You can apply what you learn in this video to the above instructions on how to use the template files in your world.
  (NOTE: The UI of the Template Manager has changed a bit since he made this video, but the functionality of copying/pasting/loading remains the same.)
