Pressing $(l)$(k:jei.showUses)$(reset) will show you all the uses for the item instead (i.e. pressing it on oak logs will show that you can use it to craft planks and wood, among other things). Lastly, $(l)clicking on the title$(reset) (i.e. “Crafting”, “Smelting” etc.) will show all the available recipes for that action."
