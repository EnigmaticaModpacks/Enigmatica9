# Setup

Follow these steps to setup your workspace:

## CurseForge App (Windows / Mac)

1. Download the [CurseForge App](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.
2. Fork and clone the repository to the Instances folder of the CurseForge App, the default path is `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Curse\Minecraft\Instances`.

    - _Note: If you've previously used the Twitch App the path will most likely be `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances`._

3. Double click the script `InstanceSyncSetup.bat` to setup InstanceSync. It is found in the `automation` folder.
4. Open the CurseForge App and you should see the modpack. If you already had CurseForge App open, restart it.

You're done!
