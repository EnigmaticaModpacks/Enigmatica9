				"Witches are often depicted as befriending animals, from cats and mice to snakes and lizards. The Witches of these swamps, however, have a special affinity for the native Crows. "
				""
				"Being a particularly intelligent species of bird, Crows are capable of handling numerous tasks on behalf of their Witch friends. Mix up some of their favorite seeds to offer as a gift to befriend. Either toss the Seed Mixture on the ground nearby or offer the seeds by hand. "
				""
				"Crows are very social critters, and as such will have no issues with having more of their kind around, tame as many as desired!"
				""
				"Once tamed, Sneak Right-Click on them to open a menu where they may be set to a task or equipped with trinkets, hats, or weapons such as a Warhammer!"
				""
				"================================================="
				""
				"When commanding a murder of crows, a Crow Flute becomes an indispensable tool. Sneak Right-Click the Flute to access the menu. To begin, click the Select button and then proceed by Right-Clicking each Crow to be commanded by the Flute. Consider crafting a new Flute for every set of Crows to be commanded to prevent mix-ups with commands."
				""
				"With a Flute, multiple Crows may be selected and commanded to perform their actions, either Harvesting nearby crops, Gathering nearby items, or Pickpocketing nearby Villagers. "
				""
				"Flutes are also the only way to direct a Crow to Perch at a specific location. Perching on a Coffer, for instance, allows a Gathering Crow to automatically deposit its items into the Coffer. "
				""
				"A note on Pickpocketing: Crows have a fixed list of items they’ll choose from any given profession, and the list is not based on the available trades of that villager. "
