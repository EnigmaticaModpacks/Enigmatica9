				"Redstone Wiring represents an advancement in Redstone technology, allowing a dedicated Engineer to build complex logic circuits that are less prone to the failings of traditional Redstone Dust. A color-coded channel system also allows a single small network to interact with multiple independent machines. "
				""
				"Redstone Wires may be stretched between Redstone Wire Connectors, Probe Connectors, or Interface Connectors. These carry the Redstone signal without the signal decaying. "
				""
				"Redstone Wire Connectors act as Input and Output points for a signal and may be placed directly on a block. They must have their mode and color channel set by using a Screwdriver on them."
				""
				"Redstone Probe Connectors act very much like Comparators with a few extra built-in features. Most Immersive Engineering machines will output special comparator signals that may also be read by this Connector. Refer to the Engineer’s Manual for specifics about each machine."
				""
				"Redstone Interface Connectors are used in conjunction with special blocks like Item Batchers and Logic Units, allowing the signals used by those blocks to be read."
