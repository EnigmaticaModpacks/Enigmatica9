				"Once thought to be entirely separate, the magical energies know as Source, Aura, and FE are in fact all facets of the same energy. By making use of special crystals, it becomes possible to convert between them with ease. "
				""
				"Pulsating Crystals work by absorbing Source from nearby Source Jars and converting it into usable FE. Should the area contain sufficient Aura, it will also be consumed, greatly enhancing the FE generated. "
				""
				"Resonating Crystals, on the other hand, set up an internal resonance with FE, converting it back into Source or Aura. If a Source Jar is near enough, it will send it there. If there is no jar, or if it is 100% full, the Resonating Crystal will instead convert the incoming FE to Aura and diffuse it into the atmosphere. "
