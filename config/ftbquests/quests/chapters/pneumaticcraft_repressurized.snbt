				"Central to any Pressure Mechanic’s workshop is the Pressure Chamber, which serves as both a functional machine for crafting and a battery of Air to even out usage spikes in a system. It is built as a hollow cube, either 3x3x3, 4x4x4, or 5x5x5. Starting with a small chamber is recommended as larger ones will take far longer to fill at the start."
				""
				"Pressurized Air will be input through the Valve, while items for crafting will be input through an Interface. Items may not be inserted into the Interface manually. Instead, they’ll be input via hopper or pipe. An amount of Air is used for each item transferred, meaning a stack will require 64x more air to transfer. If an item stack doesn’t want to transfer in, consider adding more Volume Upgrades."
				""
				"================================================================="
				""
				"Pressurized Air generally works in similar ways to real life, with Air wanting to flow from high to low pressure to form an equilibrium. This means that Air can flow both ways on a tube network, and the total air in a system is available for use by everything that’s connected. Of course, if one machine is draining all the Air, that may mean others won’t have enough to run. "
				""
				"Air using recipes will show the minimum Pressure they need to run. This is measured in bar. This will be displayed as a green zone on the pressure display in the recipe. Having pressure anywhere in this range is acceptable. "
				""
				"The more volume a system has, the more Air is required to reach the same pressure. Adding Volume Upgrades to machines, or simply including more machines on a line, will raise total Air a system may hold. This may temporarily lower pressure, at least until a compressor can fill it back up. "

				"Note: Care must be taken when building a Pressure Chamber and the entire structure should avoid crossing chunk boundaries. F3+G will display chunk boundaries."

Sneak + Right-Click the charged Trap with a Pneumatic Wrench to pick it up. Now place it down near most any mob and Sneak + Right-Click it with an empty hand to open it. Nearby mobs will be sucked in and be added to the Core."

				"The Trap works more efficiently if it has Memory Essence in the internal tank, meaning it takes fewer mobs to completely fill it. "
				""
				"Random mobs may be released from a core by Sneak + Right-Clicking it on the ground, allowing easier transportation of mobs even before the Pressurized Spawner is available. "
