				"Redstone Modules are used to read and output Redstone signals by transmitting them over a pipe network. Each Module may be set to a color channel, allowing up to 16 different signals over the same tube network."
				""
				"This requires no air and signals do not degrade over distance. "
				""
				"Installing a Module Expansion card into a Module in Receiving mode, it may be set to behave exactly like a vanilla Comparator, getting a signal from blocks that emit special values for Comparators, like the Refinery."
				""
				"By installing such a card into a Module in Emitting mode, several features become available. For example, by making use of the color channels, it can function as an AND gate, OR gate, compare against another channel or against a constant value, and much more. By chaining them together, some truly compact Redstone logic can be made."
