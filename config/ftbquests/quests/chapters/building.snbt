				"Quark is such a massive mod, and while it could have had it's own section, or even be part of the main Building section, we felt like having it as a stand-alone info quest fits better. While it would be near impossible to write down everything Quark has to offer, the below are some of the highlights for builders to make their life a little easier."
				""
				"- Decorative Blocks: Quark offers a plethora of blocks, both crafted like the different themed Chests, or gathered from around the world like the Corundum Crystal Blocks."
				""
				"- Trowel: This tool allows the randomization of block placement. It selects block(s) for your hotbar when used."
				""
				"- Burning Vines: You can burn the end of a Vine with Flint \\& Steel to stop them from growing further down. No more stringy Vanilla hacks!!"
				""
				"- Pickarang: Breaks blocks at an extreme range, and brings them back to you."
				""
				"For more information on what else does Quark has to offer you as a builder, visit their official website."
