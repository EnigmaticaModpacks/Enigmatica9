				"Choose the schematic you want to create by mousing over the box in the middle of the GUI and scrolling. Place an Empty Schematic into the left slot on the table. Click the checkmark to print the schematic - this uploads it to the server and can take a while for very large schematics. You can close the table while this process completes and come back later. Pressing the “Open Folder” button will open the Schematic folder in your instance, and pressing “Refresh” will update the list of available schematics."

				"Schematic in hand, you can place it in-world by right clicking. An on-screen HUD provides options for adjusting the schematic - moving, rotating, or flipping. Shift-right clicking the schematic will also allow you edit placement and rotation/mirroring. You can use this as a building guide, but there are better uses for it..."

				"The Schematicannon is how you're going to build your structures. It uses gunpowder as a propellent, and will take blocks from adjacent inventories."

				""
				"By default the cannon will pause if it doesn't have the block required, and it will replace any blocks in the way, but will protect tile entities (think chests and similar). Replaced blocks don't drop and are lost - the cannon IS NOT a quarry tool! These settings can be controlled by clicking the button in the bottom left."
				""
				"Note: The cannon isn't very fast, but it's possible to split the workload between multiple cannons, and Time in a Bottle works wonders on it!"
