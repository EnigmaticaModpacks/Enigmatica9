				"P2P or Point to Point, is a concept of using a single channel to transmit up to 32. Setting up a P2P connection can certainly be daunting for players who are new to AE2, but the basics are fairly accessible. "
				""
				"For example:"
				"● Place down a Controller and power it."
				"● Next, place an ME P2P Tunnel against the Controller; the flat side should be in contact with the Controller."
				"● Follow this by running a length of Red ME Glass Cable from the P2P Tunnel back to the Controller. This registers the P2P Tunnel on the network. This Red ME Glass cable will be our Controller line. Any color will do, the trick is to remain consistent and organized. "
				"● Now, from any free face on the Controller, run a Green Covered Cable. Green will represent our carrier cables and will only be used to transmit P2P connections. Again, any color will do, however avoid using anything that might accidentally cross-connect with other segments. "
				"● At the end of this Green Covered Cable, place another ME P2P Tunnel. This should place with the flat side facing out, giving a nice view of the Certus texture on that face. "
				"● Next, these two Tunnels must be linked; this is performed with a Memory Card; the color of the card does not matter."
				"● Sneak Right-Click the Card on the ME P2P Tunnel attached to the Controller. The frequency will change from 0000 to some random four-character ID. That ID is now stored in the Memory Card. "
				"● Now, take the Memory Card to the other P2P Tunnel and Right-Click the Tunnel. It should now be configured on the same Frequency ID and should display as “Linked (Output Side)”. Place a Yellow Dense Cable against the flat side of this Tunnel and all 32 channels from the Controller will now be accessible to the Yellow Dense Cable. "
				""
				"At this point, the Green Covered Cable should show that only one channel has been used, no matter how many connections are made on the Yellow cable. "
				""
				"With such a small network, this may seem like a lot of work for little gain, and that would be an accurate assessment. However, consider a larger Controller multiblock. Eight P2P Tunnels can be placed against the Controller and connected via a single Controller line as above. A single Covered Carrier line can then transmit all eight of those P2P Tunnels out to a remote place in your base. Each of those P2P Tunnels will carry 32 channels for a total of 256 channels, all being transmitted over a single Covered Cable. Whereas doing the same without P2P would require managing eight individual Dense Cables all the way out to the same remote place."

This means in many cases a separate network, or Subnetwork, will need to be built to make full use of the Formation Plane.

It may also be enchanted with Fortune or Silk Touch to allow it to efficiently process things like Certus Quartz Clusters or Ice. It cannot be filtered directly, however. To filter what it breaks, a Subnetwork is required with filtered storage that only allows the desired block to enter the system. For example, when working with Certus Quartz, to ensure it only breaks a full Certus Quartz Cluster, the subnetwork should have a filtered storage on it that only accepts Certus Quartz Crystals. A filtered Storage Bus pointed into a Chest is sufficient."
