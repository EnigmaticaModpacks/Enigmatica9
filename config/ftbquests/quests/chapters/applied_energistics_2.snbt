				"   using anything that might accidentally cross-connect "
				"   with other segments. "
				""
				"5. At the end of this Green Covered Cable, place another "
				"   ME P2P Tunnel. This should place with the flat side "
				"   facing out, giving a nice view of the Certus texture on "
				"   that face. "
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"6. Next, these two Tunnels must be linked; this is "
				"   performed with a Memory Card; the color of the card "
				"   does not matter."

				"7. Sneak Right-Click the Card on the ME P2P Tunnel "
				"   attached to the Controller. The frequency will change "
				"   from 0000 to some random four-character ID. "
				"   That ID is now stored in the Memory Card. "
				""
				"10. Now, take the Memory Card to the other P2P Tunnel "

				"    display as “Linked (Output Side)”. Place a Yellow "
				"    Dense Cable against the flat side of this Tunnel and "
				"    all 32 channels from the Controller will now be "
				"    accessible to the Yellow Dense Cable. "
				""
				"At this point, the Green Covered Cable should show that only one channel has been used, no matter how many connections are made on the Yellow cable. "
				""
				"With such a small network, this may seem like a lot of work for little gain, and that would be an accurate assessment. However, consider a larger Controller multiblock: "

Molecular Assemblers are also capable of automating the Smithing Table and Stonecutter. The process is identical to basic crafting recipes."
				""
				"For crafts involving other machines, otherwise known as Processing Patterns, the Pattern Provider should be placed adjacent to the machine on the correct side. For example, automating a vanilla Furnace would require the Pattern Provider to be set on top of the furnace and would require something, such as a hopper, to pull the result from the bottom and return it through a Pattern Provider. "

				"In many cases, it is simplest to use other logistics mods to hand dispensing the inputs and retrieving the outputs, but that’s an exercise for you to solve. "
				""
				"Machines such as Mekanism or Thermal machines, which can push back out the same side they received items on are therefore much simpler to automate, as a single Pattern Provider is all that is needed. "

For example, when working with Certus Quartz, to ensure it only breaks a full Certus Quartz Cluster, the subnetwork should have a filtered storage on it that only accepts Certus Quartz Crystals. A filtered Storage Bus pointed into a Chest is sufficient."
