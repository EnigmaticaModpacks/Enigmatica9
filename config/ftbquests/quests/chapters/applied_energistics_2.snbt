				""
				"At this point, the Green Covered Cable should show that only one channel has been used, no matter how many connections are made on the Yellow cable. "

This means in many cases a separate network, or Subnetwork, will need to be built to make full use of the Formation Plane.

It may also be enchanted with Fortune or Silk Touch to allow it to efficiently process things like Certus Quartz Clusters or Ice. It cannot be filtered directly, however. To filter what it breaks, a Subnetwork is required with filtered storage that only allows the desired block to enter the system. For example, when working with Certus Quartz, to ensure it only breaks a full Certus Quartz Cluster, the subnetwork should have a filtered storage on it that only accepts Certus Quartz Crystals. A filtered Storage Bus pointed into a Chest is sufficient."
