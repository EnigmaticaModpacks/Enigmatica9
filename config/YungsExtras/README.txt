This directory is for a few additional options for YUNG's Extras.
Options provided may vary by version.
This directory contains subdirectories for supported versions. The first time you run YUNG's Extras, a version subdirectory will be created if that version supports advanced options.
For example, the first time you use YUNG's Extras for MC 1.16 on Forge, the 'forge-1_16' subdirectory will be created in this folder.
If no subdirectory for your version is created, then that version probably does not support the additional options.

NOTE -- AS OF 1.19, ALL SPAWN RATE RELATED OPTIONS MUST NOW BE MODIFIED VIA DATA PACK.
