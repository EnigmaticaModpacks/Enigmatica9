**Breaking Changes**

Due to an issue between EveryComp and Macaw's mods and MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod, we've unfortunately had to remove Macaw's and MrCrayfish's mods. We did not want to remove any of those mods, but the modpack would be virtually unplayable with less than 16GB allocated if we hadn't.
